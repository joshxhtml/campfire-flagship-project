The Plan:
	
	Skeeball is a fun game, 
	Peggle and Nubbys Number Factory are also fun games
	
	Why not, combine the two in a way
	A skeeball game with all the fun and randomness mechanics of the 2 games before it
	
	How will this work, great question im just gonna ball it as we go
	
	First step is just remaking basic skee ball
